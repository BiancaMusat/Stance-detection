72,biggy,"Not being from New York, maybe this discussion isn't meant for me, but I have to weigh in. I grew up in the country, on a farm, with a man for a father. He taught me to be like him: wake up early, work hard, eat a good meal, go to bed, repeat. He taught me that it is the responsibility of the strong to stand up for the weak, to do the right thing because it's right and not because someone is watching, to treat everyone with respect even if you loath them. He taught me how to shoot a gun, how to hunt, and the responsibilities that each of those carry with them.

128,J. Mark Danley,"I am always amazed at the number of people I see in a library. At the college where I teach, students pack the large computer center, use the stacks of books and study (just as I did 40 years ago) at the tables. The addition of small, private meeting rooms in our new facility allow students to congregate in study groups without disturbing others.

265,Concerned Citizen,"You've got it all wrong. I am reminded of the prophetic commercial for Xerox ""on demand"" copiers; of course the commercial had everything to do with THIS and little with the product. A droning teacher is telling a large college class, presumably in English or Creative Writing, that they have to create a good, salable product that a publisher would WANT to publish (and edit) for a profit. Then a smarty pants student stands up, tells everyone about the Xerox system (whereby one could theoretically print just a single book) and tells the class ""Now, EVERYONE can be a published author!"" The elated class, thrilled to hear they don't have to learn to write well, market themselves, edit anything or make a profit for the publisher...STAND and applaud.

First of all, it seems that most of the new books are by celebrity authors, many of which are just using their name to sell books and never wrote a word.

Go into a book store and look at the crap on display. Where do they find these books? With bookstore shelf space at a premium, I welcome anything that allows the little guy a chance.

318,Dave,"I agree with this, and I would add that I think they can even change the results with their questions. Undoubtedly some policers either have polled or will poll the question, ""Do you think Bernie Sanders can win the election?"" A lot of people are more interested in this kind of question than questions of real policy, because it gives them a chance to feel like an expert on the subject of politics. The obvious correct answer is no, so most people will say no. But that question is biassed by existing poll numbers. Nobody knows who can win, but everyone wants to think they know because they like predictability.

371,WJH,"It strikes me that the problem is not one of architecture but of the ways in which economics drives and is used to drive development. The only thing any contemporary city knows to do is to give economic incentives to build structures that maximize tax revenues, primarily real estate taxes. Supposedly the increased revenues will be distributed as economic and social benefits. But this model has run its course. New York, for example, turning into an outlandishly expensive and impervious island of wealth. As service providers, both blue and white collar, are driven further and further from the center they find it necessary to commute inward by automobile.

414,Sierra,"I have worked internationally for 15 years and knowing French, German, and Russian was a life saver. I learned French along with English in school, German came from my in-laws, and Russian was my first language and it came from my grandparents. When I was in college in the 1980s, everyone was required to take at least 1 year of a foreign language. Each major had its own language option(s). And yes, my major's options were French, Russian, and German. I took Russian so I could get better at reading and writing. Languages should start in elementary school, at least the very basics. In middle school, it would be great if students had options of French or German.

429,Markl1214,"Police operate under stress. True. However, what is becoming more apparent is that officers for whatever reason are increasingly just too afraid of their job to be trusted with firearms. Rather than engaging a suspect with less than lethal force and running some risk of injury, police officers are becoming ever more reliant on deadly force to eliminate the risk. People are being shot in circumstances in which a cop of a generation ago never would have unholstered his weapon.

Otherwise many will read something with no discussion and think the article is valid, when it's not.

I have often learned things from comment sections that added value or clarified issues that were not address in the article but should have been. The solution for bigotry and vitriol is not taking the voice from people. Censorship should never be allowed. There are several way to address this issue when it comes to forums.

536,Nora Martin,"Having worked in the public library sector in Australia for over 20 years, I am a strong advocate of life-long learning and equity in access to information, thus I support the Open Access movement. In May 2012 I started in a fixed-term contract position at a University Library, my first foray into academic librarianship. As such, the topic of digital libraries and institutional repositories is of personal interest to me. The Open Access movement and institutional repositories have openly challenged the traditional scholarly communication system, supporting a new model for scholarly communication. Indeed, it is possible for academic libraries to alleviate the conflict between these two paradigms.

However, I also want to add that a place with books, whether it is my house or a library, is a vital resource that brings benefits not to be found on the Internet (I am a technologist, by the way). Our local library was been closed for a couple of years for a major renovation and to save money (no good alternative was offered or created in the community). Not having a library is like losing the heart of the community. I find libraries superior to the Internet for what most people believe they get best online: random access to information and facts. Online, I don't come across things for which I am not searching. In a library, it is all there before me, waiting.

573,David Naylor,"Among the many services that libraries have traditionally provided, perhaps the most important are access to physical copies of published works, and access to information. As the publishing industry transforms, not surprisingly the borrowing of physical books from libraries is likely to decline. However, the need for access to information is likely to grow. This access to information is provided not only by devices and infrastructure but also is supported by the library staff who provide invaluable assistance. They assist with the tools, and serve as guides and navigators around the rapidly growing sources and forms of online information. Looking further into the future, as educational institutions become transformed by the widespread availability of free online courses, and distributed learning becomes the norm, there is another potential role for libraries as learning centers.

667,oh,"I think the issue that we ought to be able to agree on, is that birth right citizenship has to end. The motivation for immigration can vary, but poverty and lack of opportunity in the country of origin seems like its often a cause. And international policies that worsen prospects for a better life would have to be seen as a contributing factor as well. Yet, openly rewarding illegal immigrants with automatic birthright citizenship is incentivizing the disregard of the host country's own laws. This continuing conversation over immigration going on in the US, mirrors that going on in Europe today. It's the same issue. Do we fix the world first, and hope the desperation driving illegal immigration abates over time? Or absorb those flows of people from those troubled regions seeking a better life now?

710,John R,"With an increase in insurance mergers, and the most recent Aetna/Anthem failed merger due to the FTC, there has been a substantial decrease in competition within the insurance sector. Lack of competition is bad for consumers because there are less players fighting for your business, so it is easier to raise, and keep prices high. Obamacare has also made it impossible for insurance companies to price policies based on pre-existing conditions, which is forcing actuaries to increase insurance costs across the board. Aetna has lost hundreds of millions of dollars on it's Affordable Care Act arm and is dropping the option in 11 out of the 15 states where it was offered. If insurance companies keep getting strangled by the government, there will be a sharp decrease in the participation rate of the Affordable Care Act and the Gov't may be left on the hook to provide policies (socialism) although I'm not sure what would happen if private participation drops off a cliff.

At the end of the summer, they threw away my work, because no one had the patience to read ancient cursive and copy it, when they realized they could instead just scan. Cursive writing, through most of history, was very far removed from your beautiful, cherished, letters. It was used by underpaid recorders, of other people's transactions. The novelty of the letter 's' written as 'f', etc., wears off quickly. However, Kate Gladstone's arguments for teaching children to read cursive, and to write hybrid, which takes little time, can confer big benefits later in life. Those who have gone through these steps learn better how to summarize, as they take notes, even if eventually on only keyboards.

I actually belong to several libraries now as a full time RVer so that I can access books on my Kindle. Yes! That most remarkable Amazon device that has allowed me to build my own library with nearly 1000 mostly free books in my Kindle Fire. At age 76, I look upon this as my personal treasury, a repositary of the wisdom of the ages. In summary, I think it's great that we have physical libraries as well as devices like the Kindle that allow us to access books from anywhere on the globe with relative ease.

925,Rev. Karen Tudor,"In our community, the most elegant, welcoming and practical buildings are our libraries. In the 9 years I have lived here, two libraries have been built and one redesigned and refurbished. Like the comments about the need for internet access among the poor, libraries ARE so much more. They have become a cultural, community hub for education, community activism, art, music, video and social interaction. One library has attracted the local gardening society to create and maintain a butterfly garden with many native plants that are marked for people to learn about them.

927,Patricia,I don't think the drug reform or criminal justice reform movements would be where they are right now if not for the power of online comments. The media status quo have in the past supported the Drug War without question and played respectability politics to keep drug reform arguments out of the public eye. That's one of the things that got us into mass incarceration in the first place. A big reason why we are moving out of that period now is because various people outside the media elite who have their facts together on drug and criminal justice reform were able to use comments sections to communicate arguments about race and drug enforcement and criminal justice policy that the media status quo wasn't ready to play in prime time. This wound up educating the media status quo and now the way the media cover drug policy has changed completely.

1043,Justice Holmes,Monopolies as monopolies are always dangerous which is why when one is permitted it must be under the tight control of the government and it must be by law committed to the betterment of the customer's interests and those of the public. Once a monopoly is permitted it is no longer a typical corporations competing with others. It is by definition the only place that a consumer can turn for that product or service thus its power to abuse that situation is massive and must be strictly controlled. It's price structure cannot be allowed to be government only by the corporations interests and the way it conducts its business must be a matter of public scrutiny. Google is no different....it has already shown its monopolistic tendencies by freezing out other content and preferring serve results thst are beneficial to it and its partners thus depriving users of intimations that may be beneficial to them.

1234,elizabeth renant,"The only solidarity the hijab shows is with that most ancient of patriarchal male control strategies, shifting the burden of morality, family and male honor, etc., onto the shoulders of female modesty. It is no different from Orthodox Jewish married women having to cover their hair, or the in the Middle Ages married women in Europe were expected to wear a coif to cover their hair, and is nakedly an attempt to confine women's sexual nature in as small a space as possible. It stands in relationship to footbinding and to female genital mutilation, albeit at another point on the bellcurve of control of women and control of female sexuality. If you insist on sacrificing yourself on this altar to show ethnic solidarity, don't be surprised when people conclude that Islam is still stuck in the past.

1262,Earthling,"According to the Centers for Disease Control, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years. The percentage of children aged 6-11 years in the United States who were obese increased from 7% in 1980 to nearly 18% in 2012. Similarly, the percentage of adolescents aged 12-19 years who were obese increased from 5% to nearly 21% over the same period. Now, more than one-third of American children and adolescents are overweight or obese. The obesity epidemic is linked to screen time, to kids sitting on their butts looking at screens all day, to the lack of outdoor activity and exercise. Mind and body are interactive systems and without a healthy body, there can be no healthy mind. How many yougn people these days are depressed, or hyperactive, or otherwise suffering from some mental disorder --- and how many would benefit from fresh air and exercise and time in the natural world?

1517,rockyraccoon,"I have worked in a variety of office environments since 1978. There is no question that the open office concept interferes with productivity for jobs that require concentration. I found it degrading to be put in a bullpen after having a windowless private office (which was also modular). There is nothing like shutting a door to say to people, don't bother me, I'm working. Movement and ambient noise are highly distracting. If you are visible, anyone can feel free to interrupt you.

1534,Michael Sapko,"This statement by the author: ""One concern is that releasing genetically engineered mosquitoes could even make the dengue situation worse, perhaps by reducing immunity to the more serious form of the disease."" is not entirely accurate. The study cited (the link is kindly provided) actually indicates that a vaccination program should be conducted before releasing GM mosquitos in places with high wild type mosquito density.

1573,Rachel,"As a student, I don't mind internships that are considered volunteer positions as much as internships that are paid in college credit. I'm willing to work for free if I can gain valuable experience. I'm not willing to actually pay tuition to work, especially since full-time college students can get sufficient credit hours in four years as long as they don't fail any classes, making any extra college credits basically useless.

1689,Diana,"When I am confronted by religious practitioners passionately arguing for absolute religious freedom I have lately started to pose questions of them rather than argue. For example, how should we deal with a religious group that practices cannibalism? Among those societies that have practiced it, there has been a sacred and even reverential set of beliefs built around sharing in the admirable qualities of the person whose flesh is shared. Supposedly wine becomes blood and bread becomes flesh during Communion. I am met with incredulous stares when I mention this. It could never happen, I am told. When I press on further and ask about female genital mutilation, which IS practiced in certain cultural/religious cultures today, I am met with silence. My point is that there are limits to religious freedom even if we don't codify them. These limits seem to be that religious freedom ends when harm to others starts and no amount of sincere, passionate belief in some deity can overcome them. We know intuitively what we as a society are willing to accept and harming children is not among them. What we do to ourselves as adults is one thing.

1732,M.E.,"Nick, homeschooled kids are part of society. They just don't go to public school, same as private school kids. In my state, the state athletic organization that oversees high school sports created guidelines for homeschooler participation in high school sports. They must meet academic and other requirements that enrolled kids must meet, but as long as they do, they are eligible. The overseeing organization realized that excluding homeschoolers was indeed discriminatory, and set about creating a system within which they could participate. In other states, there are laws on the books that require schools to allow homeschoolers to participate in school activities. My daughter was very involved in sports, and very talented at it, and she took advantage of both elite leagues and her high school teams (she was an enrolled student, not a homeschooler). The elite leagues are available to those who can make the teams, true, and most serious athletes participate in them.

I can say from experience that it's a far better screening tool than a job interview, and worth every penny. I think unpaid internships are fine, but in limited circumstances--for example, if the student is still in college and can get academic credit. In this case, though, you'd want to make sure that the student is getting training and is not forced to do menial tasks. I had some internships like this in college and they were very beneficial.

Why are we so quick to say Latino families should be afforded higher education? How, in this age of political correctness, is that okay? Are we going to run around wearing Brown Pride shirts next? If white folk decided to have ' white only ' forums or ' white only ' college programs that would be labeled racist and exclusionary. We Latinos separate ourselves ENOUGH by insisting on very little to zero assimilation in our communities and on being Latin in everything we say, do, read and watch. We even teach our children to shun away from saying they are Americans like its a bad thing. College is NOT a right.
