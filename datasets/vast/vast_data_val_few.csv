I download audible books frequently, but I don't use my local northern NY library system to do it, I use the NY City Library. If I do want a book I locate it on Amazon (since its presentation of the book: description, professional and reader reviews is much better than the libraries) then I order it (on-line) from my local library system.

In my community, the libraries also provide free access to private community rooms where people can meet for many different reasons. Finally, my computer is great, but when I want to relax and read I want a good old fashioned book. Libraries are wonderful places and we need them.",1

9,9,amazon,"Interesting article. Is Amazon trying for a monopoly on publishing as well? For a writer (like myself) the opportunity of Amazon is the most appealing in regards to finacial benefits. Publishing companies demand, in my opinion, a ridiculous about of royalties. Amazon lets the author keep almost all of the royalties and also the money. The only downside would have to be advertisment and publicity. Publishing companies get the word out far. Amazon pretting much leaves you on your own. So, depending on how good your book is, the profit could fluctuate in each circumstance. If the book is good, I'd publish it through Amazon. If the book was semi-good, I'd go to a publisher. Simple.

Many libraries do dual duty as de facto community centers. Using the internet at home to do research is fine, Wikipedia is not a peer reviewed source that is accepted as a reference for many schools and universities. Scholarly databases that provide access to academic journals are available at libraries and are usually not affordable for most people.

He taught me that it is the responsibility of the strong to stand up for the weak, to do the right thing because it's right and not because someone is watching, to treat everyone with respect even if you loath them. He taught me how to shoot a gun, how to hunt, and the responsibilities that each of those carry with them.

I'm a healthcare professional who is British by birth and has lived and worked in the US (18 years and I'm now a US citizen) but also the UK, France and Denmark. The current US system is basically rubbish compared the the European ones. I'm currently back in the US for an extended period working independently. I can't afford healthcare here.

If a cat is going to be exclusively an indoor kitty, and the alternative is the destruction of most of your furniture, then this seems a reasonable choice to me as a last resort. My parents left me with an entire house full of badly scratched furniture (including a Steinway grand piano!) thanks to not wanting to get their cat de-clawed. In their later years the cat often scratched them as well. The only caveat I would have is that if the cat ever gets out and runs away, it is probably doomed with no defense against wildlife, dogs, whatever. My own cats can go outside, and of course have their claws intact.",1

No doubt, she's extremely well paid for promoting the on-campus life-style to gullible consumers. But why do the other contributors and comments miss the boat on this topic? University has become very expensive and middle-class families should not be running up the bill by sending students away to school.

The addition of small, private meeting rooms in our new facility allow students to congregate in study groups without disturbing others. Public libraries are also a hive of activity as people who struggle through the recession use the lending of books, movies and music to remain entertained at virtually no cost. Benjamin Franklin would be proud of this American legacy, yet so often it is the first to lose public funding.

Learning involves interaction not only with students but with peers. By understanding where you stand among peers and listening to their interpretations of the subject, a person learns far more than the simple course material. They learn how to think, how to interact with peers and teachers, and to have some sense of the larger world. Home schooled children tend to test well but how many of them have gone on to really grow in a career? How many of them have a real understanding of what it means to be part of a group?

Thus, should an interviewer encounter someone with a more nuanced view or deeper understanding, those responses are far less likely to be included, let alone even documented. Interviewers generally get paid by the number of completed surveys. Thus polls would tend to reflect the attitude of the least educated and least critical thinkers among us.

180,180,college student,"As a student, I don't mind internships that are considered volunteer positions as much as internships that are paid in college credit. I'm willing to work for free if I can gain valuable experience. I'm not willing to actually pay tuition to work, especially since full-time college students can get sufficient credit hours in four years as long as they don't fail any classes, making any extra college credits basically useless. If I were to place any restrictions on unpaid internships, I would say it's valid to limit the number of hours employers can require a student to work unpaid. If it's the summer and you're only working at your internship part-time, you can get another job to pay your expenses. Of course it's not fair to those who have no support from their families, but internships that actually provide experience in the field serve a pretty big value to society, and I don't think playing fair is a good enough reason to get rid of them altogether.",1

He can then be treated by a doctor, an office manager or a fellow patient. Mr. Stager may have some good ideas about integrating computer learning and traditional teachers. Few people would object to that. Mainly, he seems to be advocating one more experiment in meeting students at the lowest common denominator of their attention span and undercutting the expertise and authority of the teacher.

The only thing any contemporary city knows to do is to give economic incentives to build structures that maximize tax revenues, primarily real estate taxes. Supposedly the increased revenues will be distributed as economic and social benefits. But this model has run its course. New York, for example, turning into an outlandishly expensive and impervious island of wealth. As service providers, both blue and white collar, are driven further and further from the center they find it necessary to commute inward by automobile. Automobiles are resisted by the wealthy center as ugly noisy dispensers of pollution and pedestrian risk. Even the NY public transit system is quite unable to overcome the need for commuting by personal vehicle. This is clearly pushing to unsustainability. What needs to be worked out is a mode of increasing revenue that does not prejudice development.",2

The space is free, the walls are lined with books, and you can travel around the world, back in time, and to distant planets during your breaks. I once had a high school teacher who took points off of a report because I did not include pictures. I explained that the library did not allow you to cut pictures out of the magazines.

As such, the topic of digital libraries and institutional repositories is of personal interest to me. The Open Access movement and institutional repositories have openly challenged the traditional scholarly communication system, supporting a new model for scholarly communication. Indeed, it is possible for academic libraries to alleviate the conflict between these two paradigms. Institutional repositories (by their very nature) exert pressure on journal publishers to permit as much free online access to their content as economically possible.

Then we go from 'bodies' to prostitution - a business - many businesses sell objects and should be free to do so. So, from your argument, it is the business, which uses bodies as commodities/objects, that should be free of stigmatization? Legalizing prostitution codifies the dehumanization of women, continues the War on Women, and should not be hideously reframed as emancipation.",2
292,292,library,"Among the many services that libraries have traditionally provided, perhaps the most important are access to physical copies of published works, and access to information. As the publishing industry transforms, not surprisingly the borrowing of physical books from libraries is likely to decline. However, the need for access to information is likely to grow. This access to information is provided not only by devices and infrastructure but also is supported by the library staff who provide invaluable assistance. They assist with the tools, and serve as guides and navigators around the rapidly growing sources and forms of online information. Looking further into the future, as educational institutions become transformed by the widespread availability of free online courses, and distributed learning becomes the norm, there is another potential role for libraries as learning centers. In this case the facility not only provides the access devices, but can also host tutors and local study groups. As access to steadily growing amounts of information becomes more important for all members of society perhaps the role and services of libraries might actually increase rather than decline.",1

I witnessed a circumcision, I find it barbaric and cruel to a baby. I am a Jew and will not circumcise any boy. The only time it is acceptable would be for health or hygiene.

(4) It incentivizes illegal immigrants having kids and the US taxpayer directly or indirectly pays for the maternity. (5) It allows children of illegal parents to qualify for the full array of US entitlements, that in most cases a legal immigrant family would not receive.

These limits seem to be that religious freedom ends when harm to others starts and no amount of sincere, passionate belief in some deity can overcome them.

So, do we legalize prostitution so the level of sex addiction that will always be with us becomes abundantly clear?

And international policies that worsen prospects for a better life would have to be seen as a contributing factor as well. Yet, openly rewarding illegal immigrants with automatic birthright citizenship is incentivizing the disregard of the host country's own laws. This continuing conversation over immigration going on in the US, mirrors that going on in Europe today. It's the same issue. Do we fix the world first, and hope the desperation driving illegal immigration abates over time? Or absorb those flows of people from those troubled regions seeking a better life now? I think its better, and more fair to all concerned, to have a managed process for documented labor, visitation and immigration, than a mad lawless rush across borders.

Too many of the students vote for what they think sounds cool. They don't think about or care about the consequences. It's easy to vote for a new tax or bond when you aren't the ones paying for it. It's just so cool to vote for a city or county politician who advocates for free everything -- more subsidized housing and shelters for the homeless and drug treatment centers and...on and on -- when every summer you return to your mom and dad's comfortable home in a leafy suburb far, far away. Voting should be tied to one's legal address, period. And for dependent children, that legal address should be where mom and/or dad, or legal guardians, live.",2
347,347,home schoolers,"Nick, homeschooled kids are part of society. They just don't go to public school, same as private school kids. In my state, the state athletic organization that oversees high school sports created guidelines for homeschooler participation in high school sports. They must meet academic and other requirements that enrolled kids must meet, but as long as they do, they are eligible. The overseeing organization realized that excluding homeschoolers was indeed discriminatory, and set about creating a system within which they could participate. In other states, there are laws on the books that require schools to allow homeschoolers to participate in school activities. My daughter was very involved in sports, and very talented at it, and she took advantage of both elite leagues and her high school teams (she was an enrolled student, not a homeschooler). The elite leagues are available to those who can make the teams, true, and most serious athletes participate in them. It's the lack of programs for the average kid after the age of 14 that's a problem. Also, even those who can make the elite teams can't always afford the fees.",1

Lack of competition is bad for consumers because there are less players fighting for your business, so it is easier to raise, and keep prices high. Obamacare has also made it impossible for insurance companies to price policies based on pre-existing conditions, which is forcing actuaries to increase insurance costs across the board. Aetna has lost hundreds of millions of dollars on it's Affordable Care Act arm and is dropping the option in 11 out of the 15 states where it was offered. If insurance companies keep getting strangled by the government, there will be a sharp decrease in the participation rate of the Affordable Care Act and the Gov't may be left on the hook to provide policies (socialism) although I'm not sure what would happen if private participation drops off a cliff.

At the end of the summer, they threw away my work, because no one had the patience to read ancient cursive and copy it, when they realized they could instead just scan. Cursive writing, through most of history, was very far removed from your beautiful, cherished, letters. It was used by underpaid recorders, of other people's transactions. The novelty of the letter 's' written as 'f', etc., wears off quickly. However, Kate Gladstone's arguments for teaching children to read cursive, and to write hybrid, which takes little time, can confer big benefits later in life. Those who have gone through these steps learn better how to summarize, as they take notes, even if eventually on only keyboards. A side benefit is that they can appreciate cursive, and the history it sometimes cradles.",1

Obama has restored the balance by taking away the insurance companies' ability to block consumers from receiving medical care.

These obligations pale in comparision with,( like all citizens do),the benefits, advantages and rights I enjoy at the same time. In fact, what I want is a far less complicated, straight-forward, far more liberal and universally applicable health care system that is at least comparable to what are obtaining presently in France,UK and Scandinavia.I don't mind the personal costs,no one should, I believe.It is the basic minimum that any nation should render to its citizens.And it could prove to be quite cheaper than whatever provided by any insurance company and far more efficient, if wisely administered. Anyway, I personally believe, ofcourse buttressed by my own calculations and ratified by my intellectual friends, that the rich are indeed the free loaders in any society, extracting far higher benefits from it than what they themselves contribute.But they make the maximum noise and grossly distort the reality for denying the middle class and the poor what they richly deserve-- through rational logic and by canons of progressive civilizations.",1

455,455,library,"As a former teacher and long-time first grade volunteer in a low income school district, I regularly use the CLEVNET system to get books for our class that compliment our curriculum or that are about subjects in which the kids express interest. We develop a reading list of the books shared each year, and let kids know they have access to them all through our local library. For communities in which books are an unaffordable luxury, libraries level the playing field, giving access to unlimited literary riches to all. In our community, they also provide much needed parenting help through story times and reading activities for caregivers and young children every week. Many families without computers at home get access to the internet at the library for homework help, employment and tax information. While libraries may be redundant for more affluent families, they provide a window into a different present and future for those of lesser means.",1

They have become a cultural, community hub for education, community activism, art, music, video and social interaction. One library has attracted the local gardening society to create and maintain a butterfly garden with many native plants that are marked for people to learn about them. Another group has offered to create a meandering walking path around the expanse of the building for reflection and a chance to walk in beauty outdoors.

That's one of the things that got us into mass incarceration in the first place. A big reason why we are moving out of that period now is because various people outside the media elite who have their facts together on drug and criminal justice reform were able to use comments sections to communicate arguments about race and drug enforcement and criminal justice policy that the media status quo wasn't ready to play in prime time. This wound up educating the media status quo and now the way the media cover drug policy has changed completely. This is a victory for democracy and for online comments.,1

Defining the meaning of ""under the jurisdiction of the United States"" to exclude those who entered the country illegally or are here on short term travel visas should only require a law saying as much. The courts could strike it down, I suppose, but it's far from clear that they should, and their decision would have to explain some interesting contradictions between their position and contradictory aspects of past immigration laws.

It is by definition the only place that a consumer can turn for that product or service thus its power to abuse that situation is massive and must be strictly controlled. It's price structure cannot be allowed to be government only by the corporations interests and the way it conducts its business must be a matter of public scrutiny.

The percentage of children aged 6-11 years in the United States who were obese increased from 7% in 1980 to nearly 18% in 2012. Similarly, the percentage of adolescents aged 12-19 years who were obese increased from 5% to nearly 21% over the same period. Now, more than one-third of American children and adolescents are overweight or obese. The obesity epidemic is linked to screen time, to kids sitting on their butts looking at screens all day, to the lack of outdoor activity and exercise. Mind and body are interactive systems and without a healthy body, there can be no healthy mind. How many yougn people these days are depressed, or hyperactive, or otherwise suffering from some mental disorder --- and how many would benefit from fresh air and exercise and time in the natural world?

And younger people are paying more to reduce the age penalty as they get older, much like we do for Medicare.

A piece of ""criticism"" is worthwhile not because of its particular opinion, but because it is entertaining, provocative, and illuminating not just of the particular work but of the work's place in a larger historical, artistic and social context. Ultimately, any ""critic"" stands or falls on self-revelation: the subject under scrutiny is as much his or her particular prejudices, enthusiasms and acuity as the work under discussion. Professional critics are crucial to cultural vitality in many ways - as champions of unfamiliar works, as stimulators of curiosity, as goads to clearer, deeper thinking about an artistic experience, to name a few.

Learning a foreign language benefits brain heath by increasing one's 'cognitive reserve'. Languages differ from one another in the ideas they are able to express: French, for instance, has a more limited vocabulary than English but expresses many ideas much more precisely. Finally, for hundreds of years, if not since antiquity, knowing more than one language was de rigueur for an educated and civilized person. One was not even considered educated without familiarity with at least one classical language and at least two modern ones.

The illegality of it isn't stopping that. Legalization would bring a huge underground industry into the open. Furthermore, the negative opinions make it sound like every computer in America will be wired into an online casino. School and workplace computers will certainly not be able to do that without detection by supervisors, and parents can keep their kids away by making sure they don't have access to credit cards. The simple fact is that millions of Americans enjoy gambling and do so responsibly.

In my state, the state athletic organization that oversees high school sports created guidelines for homeschooler participation in high school sports. They must meet academic and other requirements that enrolled kids must meet, but as long as they do, they are eligible. The overseeing organization realized that excluding homeschoolers was indeed discriminatory, and set about creating a system within which they could participate. In other states, there are laws on the books that require schools to allow homeschoolers to participate in school activities. My daughter was very involved in sports, and very talented at it, and she took advantage of both elite leagues and her high school teams (she was an enrolled student, not a homeschooler). The elite leagues are available to those who can make the teams, true, and most serious athletes participate in them. It's the lack of programs for the average kid after the age of 14 that's a problem. Also, even those who can make the elite teams can't always afford the fees.",0

It is a well-known fact that declawed cats are deprived of their main form of defense (claws), and resort to biting. Additionally, it is painful for many declawed cats to dig in a litter box. Hence, house soiling. Shelters I have volunteered at have quite a few declawed cats come in due to these reasons, declawing being the source of these issues. Pet owners who want to declaw a cat should not have a cat--period. If you want to protect your furniture, do not own a cat. Cats naturally scratch. If dog owners don't want their animal to jump on their couches or beds, do they remove a dog's leg? If dog owners don't want a dog to bark, is debarking humane? It's the same thing as declawing a cat. Just don't have one.",0

Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs."" With the reduction in energy and pesticides they seem pretty efficient to me. All organic practices are not equal. Organic systems that ""stack"" crops like growing mushrooms beneath orchards or ducks and fish being raised along side rice patties are way more ""efficient"" than conventional. Science does prove organics are healthier and safer. The irony of that recent Stanford paper is that it showed there are less antibiotic resistant bacteria on organic meat and less pesticide residue on produce. Produce grown in biologically active soil, which is achieved using organic soil building methods, does have more testable ultra-trace minerals.

Thus I was at a disadvantage compared to peers at my college. This doesn't really sound like a level playing field, does it??? One additional point: The emphasis on internship experience on resumes allows employers an easy way to ascertain which candidates are likely to come from wealthier backgrounds...making it easier for employees to discriminate in terms of social class and race (since certain races are more likely to be represented in the disadvantaged group).
