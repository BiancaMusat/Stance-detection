The best American universities recognize that they are graduating multi-dimensional human beings. Nothing could be more destructive of our civilization than to graduate one-dimensional specialists.

Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined.

592,Beth G,"Mr. Dreher, as someone who grew up with only a passing familiarity with the Bible, I would like to understand the belief of religious folk that the Bible prescribes marriage as between one man and one woman. It seems quite a number of men in the Bible have many wives. In fact it seems polygamy is the norm. Can you please reconcile that contradiction? Also, how does giving equal rights to gay folks impact your religious liberty? That one is head scratcher to me and many others, we simply do not understand the connection.

688,achilles13,For my generation NATO was mainly about defending Western Europe against the feared encroachment of the then Soviet Union. Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided. NATO's real mission ended with the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since those events NATO has been an organization in search of a purpose. It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya. The USA should move to withdraw its military and its money from Europe at the earliest opportunity. Where else to station troops? probably on our border with Mexico. I don;t suppose defending that border will be as costly as NATO has been.

781,Mack,"""Normally Supreme Court justices should refrain from commenting on partisan politics. But these are not normal times."" And who defines 'normal'? Mr. Butler? So SCOTUS justices should be respectful, impartial bystanders of presidential elections, unless Mr. Butler dislikes that candidate, or decides things aren't 'normal'. In which the SCOTUS can freely brawl in the mud like every other clownish politician. Of course, in these 'abnormal' times, should another justice lash out at Hillary, it's dollars to donuts that Mr. Butler would scream in horror at the indignation and partiality. What a funny sense of justice some people have. Speaking of normal times, the New York Times once published actual news. You know, facts backed with credible sources and evidence. But I guess these aren't normal times, opinions are much flashier and entertaining these days. I suppose Ginsberg's gaffe is a natural evolution of our classless time.

There was a time when sports competition was about sport. Against great odds today, it still is that for some competitors. They give their best effort and accept either defeat or triumph as just a part of every game, not its only measure. Those competitors are worthy of being our kids' sports hereoes. Who are they now?

925,Gloria,"There are two major points that bother me about the possibility of players legally doping themselves. The first one is that regardless of the control and vigilance exerted over the use of game enhancing drugs, there will always be secondary effects that will either affect the athlete in the sport or later, at home or over a longer period of time. I don't know if it is ever truly ethical to affect a person's long term health over a short period gain. The second problem I have with this doping issue is the unfair advantage it gives over other players. It is pretty clearly observed in the Olympics that very developed countries (USA, England, Germany, China, etc.) have funds to give a boost and every advantage possible to already talented athletes. It just seems to me that these drugs are something that would be more affordable and easier to monitor where money flows, creating an even bigger gap between economically advantaged players and those with less resources (even if they are physically on par to each other).

1011,Guy,"Wow. After a quick skim of the comments, there seems to be a consensus that past examples of breaches of judicial ethics justify any current breach. Apparently rational thought, such as expressed by Professor Gillers in this eloquent and well reasoned piece, is simply no longer applicable to today's issues.

1137,Michael,"The scarcity argument is so tiresome. We remain the wealthiest country in the world. There is no scarcity of funds; there's a lack of willingness to spend those funds on things like education. The elephant in the room here is college sports programs. (I can't believe none of the contributors to this debate even mentioned it!) Universities with elite athletic programs--and their numbers are great--are FLUSH with cash, much of it provided by taxpayers, private donors (usually alumni), and corporate donors (the latter two also being taxpayers with choices about how their incomes are spent). Meanwhile, the academic departments go begging, almost literally, for scraps.

1143,help is on the way,Free tuition will only increase college enrollments if we prepare the students for college. The tuition free education is great but we have to start preparing the students early. This way they will strive for the free education. Low income families want the best for their children and this is a way to give the minority students the same chances as other students. I believe that the community colleges are great for students and the funding if made available will allow our students to complete a 2 year degree and more forward with the motivation to get that 4 year degree.

1164,Christina,As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done .

1178,THM,"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation.

1341,Katherine Cagle,"No, don't abolish tenure, just make it more effective by giving tenure only after 4 or 5 years. Teach principals how to deal with ineffective teachers -- how to document, step up observations and evaluations, how to dismiss teachers who are not effective. The problem is that most principals don't know the difference between good and bad teachers. In my 36 years working in schools I observed that the principal usually praised the teachers who most often agreed with and flattered them. Yes, teachers usually do stay in the same job, maybe not in the same location, and it's a good thing if they do. I worked in 5 different schools over my career and the most effective schools had a good mixture of experienced and new teachers. The experienced teachers helped new teachers with discipline and techniques they had learned over the years. The new teachers added new ideas and new theories of education.

1359,Daydreamer,"Obese people live difficult lives to be sure, but pointing the finger at genetics or saying they are discriminated against is simply avoiding the ugly truth. They are addicts - plain and simple. Obesity is no more a disability than someone with a drug problem. You say genetics are to blame? Same for someone who has an addictive personality who turns to illicit drugs or alcohol. In the end, they may not be personally to blame, in full, but when it comes to drugs, you can fire the abuser instantly without repercussions.

1437,Bob Aceti,"Secular Germans accommodated Hitler during his rise to power by remaining silent. Several of these secular Germans were lawyers, justices and professors. Little did they know that over the course of 10 years - 1935-45, that their Jewish heritage would condemn them and their families, including children to genocide orchestrated by the man they thought would not be able to sway the German people to succeed as Chancellor of Germany. They were wrong. I think Justice Ginsburg has more historic perspective than we care to admit.

1575,C Wolfe,"I'm dismayed at the number of comments that miss the point, which is that we need to preserve the integrity of our intellectual tradition. Piecemeal budget cuts are a bad thing. This is not a battle between science and the humanities; it's a battle FOR a flourishing intellectual ecosystem, which is so complex as evolved that, as with the natural ecosystem, we shouldn't be driving niches into extinction. There is no enmity between the sciences and the humanities. They are richly complementary. Anecdote: For some reason, when I was an undergraduate classics major, some of the most well-rounded, thinking students I knew were geology majors. Why geology? Not sure. Maybe because it was West Virginia, where mineral wealth had long been exploited by out-of-state corporations.

Written by someone whom we have to assume is sincere, open and honest, it defies credulity to think that someone could honestly believe what is stated here. It's a massive denial of present reality and past statements, overt and covert. Tony Perkins, of Focus on the Family has said the United States is doomed if marriage equality ever becomes the law of the land. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robinson have said the most vile and hateful things about the LGBT Community for decades. Focus on the Family along with many other fundamentalist sects have long hidden their hatred under the mantra, ""Hate the sin, love the sinner.""

Right now, we talk about everyone voting, as if it was some kind of religious ritual like the Sabbath or Ramadhan. But voting is not a religious ritual, it is participation in government making. And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote. I know my point of view is unusual, in a society where voting is regarded as a kind of party - the more the better. But perhaps this is an area where skill matters. If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates.

Of course they would support mandating that people ignorant of the issues vote. That's their voting base. And the entire reason for the election and re-election of President Obama.

Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win!

I have no doubt several of my relatives were wondering why more gays weren't killed in Orlando as I've heard those comments before. They're not keen on non-christian's either.

1883,Andrew,"I believe too much emphasis is being place on voter turnout, and not enough emphasis is being placed on education. Is a low unemployment rate a good thing? Yes. Is a high rate of education a good thing? Yes. Is a high voter turnout a good thing? Well, quite frankly that depends. Why is it high? Is it high because concerned, informed citizens are making their voices heard? Not if you move the needle by making it mandatory. You see, voter turnout isn't the answer, it's an indicator.

It would strip the security of medical coverage from the most vulnerable among us, the aged. It will also burden their children with additional costs, born of of guilt. This will all result in nothing less than economic stagnation spanning generations. This country's wealthiest individuals are by far the richest and least taxed in our two hundred year history.

But, in fact, they treat divorced people very differently from gay people, and they're not even aware of their hypocrisy. If they could accept gay congregants the way they accept divorced congregants, the world would notice that the evangelical church is no longer self-righteous and judgemental and, frankly, angry.

My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture.

2084,nydoc,"This blurb fails to mention that man yyears ago, Professor Ehrlich made a highly publicized bet. With his Malthusian doom and gloom, he predicted resources would be scarcer and run out, or at least dwindle as the world population grew. He bet a not so famous economist that prices of a half dozen commodities jointly chosen by them would rise after a decade. He lost very big, as the prices went down about 30% instead of increasing. It is fairly obvious that their is a certain limit to which resources would be strained. But the focus is totally off. Poverty causes population growth, not the other way around. Scandinavia, almost all of Western Europe and Japan all have rapidly falling populations, which would be even worse if it were not for immigration. Too prevent over-population, reduce infant mortality, increase education (particular for girls), increase the standard of living (how???).

2223,Jay,"I bike regularly as exercise and have experimented with the city's initiative , attempting to bike to work. My commute is not long, from the west 100's to 60th st and Madison and so can even take advantage of central park as well as the bike lanes. I soon found that on the rare occasions when I could bike successfully without some heart stopping near or actual accident which most often caused by pedestrians not looking at bike lanes, that when I did arrive at my destination there were few if any places to lock my bike. So while locked to parking signs or mailboxes in reletively short order 2 bikes were destroyed while locked up and finally after an accident with another biker which landed me in the emergency room I gave up the experiment.

Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined.

2615,Carl Mahler,"It's strange that Christians can read the Bible and not see how many times the concept of ""marriage"" has changed. Abraham repeatedly had his wife Sarah ""marry"" other men in order to obtain advantages over those men (so much for prohibitions against committing adultery). Jacob, aka Israel, had two wives simultaneously and king Solomon had 700, but by New Testament times a man was only allowed one wife.

They made a choice to go into serious debt and now they must accept it and figure out how to deal with it. That's part of the growing up thing. Before they selected a college to attend, they should have sat down with their parents and determined which college was most affordable for them, not which college would be the grooviest to attend. Most of the issues facing the millennials result from the choices they have made over the course of their lives.

2750,Victor,"One must consider that in 1992, the year Ukraine gained independence from the former USSR, it held the world's third largest nuclear weapons arsenal. The government realized it would not be able to property maintain this arsenal and agreed, by treaty, to relinquish it on the basis that the USA and UK agreed to defend its territorial integrity. Even then, the country feared that Russia would attempt to invade or otherwise seize its lands.

Among the problems with that chart is (1) they don't tell how they defined ""needing"" or determined who ""needed"" it (2) they they include marijuana in the category of ""illicit drug."" The bulk of those 20.2 million could be marijuana users. Even with heroin, amphetamines and cocaine, you can't just assume that because somebody is using that drug, he or she is abusing it or ""needs"" treatment.

2882,Nicolas,"The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland / San José is dated. Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX.

Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms.
