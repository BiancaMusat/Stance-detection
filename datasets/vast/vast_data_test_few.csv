6,6,justice,"Ginsburg's statement has no bearing on the separations of powers nor upon how she will consider cases under review, so I do not think what she said was improper. I do not think that Ginsberg did anything inappropriate since she did not in anyway refer to anything that will ever come before the Supreme Court. The Court has no ability to make any judgments that have any effect upon the election of Presidents nor of who is appointed to the Court. Such a personal opinion will never affect anything that is addressed by the Court. If anything, she is stating something which the mass media is ignoring because it's so caught up in the sport of elections to do any relevant analysis of the foreseeable consequences of who ends up as the next President.",1

Yet, the states do a good job of running elections and the required IDs are easy to get, in a process already overseen by our heavily politicized DOJ. Regarding the extravagant demand for transportation, both major parties have local people who drive you to get IDs or to vote already. We should keep that effort in the private sector where it arose. If you are frantic enough not to trust the judicial system already, one more amendment won't cure what ails you. What would help all of us is more knowledge of history - which we won't find on the Soros blogs. Force people to vote? When all they are interested in is celebrity and sports buzz or their iPhones, absolutely not. They'll end up simply voting for the first name, and when that is a GOPer, we'll have to keep watch over the bridges in the big-city liberal-statist philosophical ghettos/campuses.",1

But then in a decade or so the consumer base you use to have run out of savings, are loaded up with debt and are systematically replaced with a new generation of workers who are paid less, have fewer benefits and less disposable income. Demand start to slip, investment opportunities in the real economy dry up and the next thing you know you have Apple sitting on a mountain of cash because they have run out of consumers who can afford their products and they can make more money out of financial speculation than trying to create profitable products that are cheap enough for an impoverished proletariat.

This is incorrect, and could lead to fatalism that could harm people who are overweight. For example, I lost 70 pounds. That was at least a year ago. It has not come back. It is easy to keep off. The studies to which you refer examine calorie restriction diets, which do not work because they induce a starvation-like state that leads to metabolic changes. Changing the *types* of foods we eat is far more productive. There's evidence that eliminating wheat alone will reduce the number of calories people eat by an average of 300 a day. Exercise has also been shown to help prevent the return of weight, though it isn't useful as a weight loss tool. Sadly, what is known today is far different from the older diet and exercise advice that many still follow.",1

Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined. There can little argument that every industry must be fast, flexible and capable to understand the implications that 3D printing will have on their businesses. Failure will mean disaster.

The ADEA does not apply to employees under the age of 40, even if they are expressly terminated because of age. Did a teacher blow the whistle on an unsavory practice at school, related to their job? Well, under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), that teacher may not have any First Amendment protection for that speech. And gay, lesbian and transgender teachers have no federal protection from discrimination unless and until our Congress passes ENDA. Until then, such discrimination is perfectly legal in many states. Oh, and most obviously, no federal job protections exist for non-discriminatory yet ""capricious"" firings -- that is at-will employment, the exact end goal for this dishonest author.",2
343,343,medicare,I like it the way it is now. Just like Social Security it was not meant for all. The system doesn't have the resources to expand it's coverage. The reason we have Medicare is to care of the elderly People pay into the system for the benefits the government will give them in the future. It won't be able to do that if the number of people getting benefits isn't fewer than the people who pay into the system. This is how some get more benefits than they put in. It's because some will get nothing. That is why it won't work if you make this benefit available to others.,1

But that will only happen with a groundswell of political opposition to the standard designs and awareness of the differences between types of nuclear reactors. The light-water and heavy-water reactor designs have become entrenched in our utility and government institutions since they were chosen in the 1940's and 1950's. That choice was made not on the basis of efficiency or safety, but because these designs could be rapidly built and because they create large quantities of uranium and plutonium waste for use in making nuclear weapons. We hold on to these older designs out of sheer regulatory inertia, and we will continue to do so to our great environmental and proliferative detriment until voters demand that the NRC and its international counterparts create frameworks that encourage the development of commercial thorium-cycle power plants.",1

470,470,doping,"There are two major points that bother me about the possibility of players legally doping themselves. The first one is that regardless of the control and vigilance exerted over the use of game enhancing drugs, there will always be secondary effects that will either affect the athlete in the sport or later, at home or over a longer period of time. I don't know if it is ever truly ethical to affect a person's long term health over a short period gain. The second problem I have with this doping issue is the unfair advantage it gives over other players. It is pretty clearly observed in the Olympics that very developed countries (USA, England, Germany, China, etc.) have funds to give a boost and every advantage possible to already talented athletes. It just seems to me that these drugs are something that would be more affordable and easier to monitor where money flows, creating an even bigger gap between economically advantaged players and those with less resources (even if they are physically on par to each other).

Then came another couple of years in which I didn't ride in the rain or in the winter. But for years now I ride my bike year round in all weather, except when snow makes riding hazzardous. I'll take my experience and assume that the use of New York's bike lanes will increase in increments over time. It's too early to say that they are merely a 'subsidy for the few.' One person sitting in a gigantic, unwieldy vehicle is still just one person, and that person doesn't have a right to own the infrastructure everyone is paying for, based solely on the virtue of taking up a lot of space. I think the most frustrating thing for car drivers who dislike the bike lanes is that they cannot justify their behavior in a city with so many alternatives to driving. Not in this day and age. The bikers present a slap in the face to every rationalization for driving a car.",1

Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done .

595,595,supreme court,"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation. This arrangement would preserve judicial independence while knocking individual justices off the thrones they currently occupy.",2

Build them and then just maybe they will come. Where I live (pop. 230,000), there's exactly one small, public rehab center currently with a 6-8 month wait list. We simply don't have the infrastructure in place to accept (or force) people into receiving help. Honestly I don't think the money nor the will is really there.

They are addicts - plain and simple. Obesity is no more a disability than someone with a drug problem. You say genetics are to blame? Same for someone who has an addictive personality who turns to illicit drugs or alcohol. In the end, they may not be personally to blame, in full, but when it comes to drugs, you can fire the abuser instantly without repercussions. Obese people are of the same ilk, except that their drug of choice is food. All the nonsense about slowed metabolisms due to defective thyroids is nothing more than smoke in mirrors. Anyone can lose weight - even lying still in bed. So, the real question isn't about discrimination, it's about leveling the playing field.

Even with heroin, amphetamines and cocaine, you can't just assume that because somebody is using that drug, he or she is abusing it or ""needs"" treatment. Many people function well even while using those drugs. For example, Ayn Rand used amphetamines. Allen Ginsberg used amphetamines. You could spend a whole semester course reading books that had been written on amphetamines. Should they have been forced into treatment?",1

This is of course not a big deal in the Middle East and I wouldn't expect anything else from the major media outlets based in that region. However, little did I know that NYT would allow for these AKP trolls to be published on the platform of such a respected site. Whatever these trolls say, and whatever the mainstream media wants to spam people with, the truth will remain the same: 1. Turkey has left their 50 year old history of secularism and gone back to their 1000 year history of radical islam to re-establish the Ottoman Empire. 2. The Kurds are one of the few people in this region who are Western-oriented and wish to establish a democratic pluralistic society. For this, Western powers should step away from the status quo that has brought nothing but civil war and what seems to be a perpetual low-grade conflict and instead support an independent Kurdistan.",1

Is it high because concerned, informed citizens are making their voices heard? Not if you move the needle by making it mandatory. You see, voter turnout isn't the answer, it's an indicator. It simply tells you what question you need to ask next. Because what we want is not a high voter turnout. What we want is a large majority of Americans making their opinions heard. While voter turnout is an indicator of that, you don't cure a disease by covering up the symptoms. If educated people tend to vote more, then that should be the focus.

It is fairly obvious that their is a certain limit to which resources would be strained. But the focus is totally off. Poverty causes population growth, not the other way around. Scandinavia, almost all of Western Europe and Japan all have rapidly falling populations, which would be even worse if it were not for immigration. Too prevent over-population, reduce infant mortality, increase education (particular for girls), increase the standard of living (how???). Over-population, poverty and environmental degradation are all closely linked. But it is important to note that increasing living standards is the best way to combat over-population.

But the whole point of having a Supreme Court is to decide what happens when the playing field isn't level. What happens, for example, when one of the players can't even get inside the stadium because he's black? Or when the players bet on the game? What happens when the game's basic integrity is at issue?

French is spoken as a native or near-native language by something like 200 million people (most of whom are not French). If you add a few hundred million more non-native speakers and consider the global distribution of places where French is important to commerce and politics, it is obviously one of the most widely spoken and influential languages in the world - and the numbers are growing, not falling. French-speaking Africa is experiencing some of the highest rates of population growth in the world, and incidentally contains a large chunk of the world's untapped supplies of oil, uranium, and other natural resources. Meanwhile, France is the only major European power whose population is actually growing, and is on track to become Western Europe's most populous country in just a few decades; so the future of French as a pan-European language also looks bright. So yes, French is a heavy hitter as global languages go. In some parts of the world, it is indispensable for diplomacy and business. So maybe - just maybe - it would be a good idea for our universities to keep teaching it.",0

I particularly noticed that the workforce crowd in the large high rise downtown office buildings in Minneapolis were of the same general age for the most part. There were vey few folks with gray hair such as myself. Perhaps this is just the way the Midwest has always been, but I found it surprising, and a bit disheartening that these folks were already middle aged in my eyes, having committed themselves to a sentence of 30 plus years in office space drudgery without testing the waters of their youth.",0

The ancient Israelites inherited a law that homosexual acts (particularly outside of a straight marriage) were sinful, but the rest of the Bible is silent on gay and lesbian people in committed relationships, or possibly it even hints at approval in the story of David and Jonathan. Anti-gay theology is a clear case of the very slicing and dicing that ultra-conservatives claim to abhor. Anyway, a people who accepted the whole Bible would have a lot of child-murder to do. Clearly even ultra-conservative Christians don't take the ancient laws at face value. If they did, then they might be allowed to claim religious liberty as an excuse to preach that gays exist outside of God's plan for humanity. But because they don't, and because the whole Bible is not clear on the subject, this boils down to a belief held by a group of people.

Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined. There can little argument that every industry must be fast, flexible and capable to understand the implications that 3D printing will have on their businesses. Failure will mean disaster.

1525,1525,religious belief,"I can't understand why the justification for the study of Humanities is utilitarian in most of the pieces and blogs in this article. Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms. It is a reality, not merely a sign of increasingly philistine times.",0
1526,1526,high speed rail,"More regulation and government intervention rather than less is definitely the answer. Any privatization, block grant or cash payment scheme will directly result in tens of millions of seniors well beyond working age becoming unable to afford medical care. It would strip the security of medical coverage from the most vulnerable among us, the aged. It will also burden their children with additional costs, born of of guilt. This will all result in nothing less than economic stagnation spanning generations. This country's wealthiest individuals are by far the richest and least taxed in our two hundred year history. These plutocrats who have enriched themselves on the backs of working men and women can afford to pay in more and take out less. America's economic security and social justice both equally depend on it.",0
1527,1527,justice ginsburg,"Dr. DuPont and the three other debaters conveniently overlook an important part of the current epidemic of prescription opioid abuse: we really know very little about it. As a physician who specializes in pain management I can tell you that we don't know how many people who are abusing and becoming addicted to these drugs obtained them illicitly, how many lied to physicians to obtain them, and how many received them for legitimate pain complaints. If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential. Do any of the debaters recommend forcing these patients into treatment for this problem? Clearly, none of the debaters has really given much thought about the many ramifications of their recommendations.",0

Heck, my daughter has well above a 4.0 and has scored high on PSAT, etc and I still worry about the rigors of college. We need to set up all students for success. If we have to teach them in college what they should have learned in high school then they are not ready for college whether it's paid for or not. I'm all for heavily subsidizing the cost of a college education for students who can't afford it because I'm a believer in the ""all boats rise"" theory and I think equal access to higher education is crucial to changing a person's trajectory in life. It's also not the only way. Yes, there are plenty of students attending college on their parents' dime who don't make it and while that wouldn't fly with me, it's their money, not mine. I feel differently about it when taxpayers are funding it.",0

1542,1542,legislation,"Conservative Christians and evangelicals have not historically condemned divorce the way that the Bible does, but they certainly have condemned homosexuality, the way the Bible doesn't. I might respect conservative Christians for their consistency if they refused to do business with divorced people, the way they want to refuse gay patrons. But conservative Christians -- like Wheaton College -- employ divorced people, serve divorced people, and welcome divorced people into communion without blinking. Their constant refrain is that they ""hate the sin, but love the sinner."" Now I'm not proposing we abolish divorce, but I do wish evangelicals would just NOTICE that sin, if they're so determined to purify our society. But, in fact, they treat divorced people very differently from gay people, and they're not even aware of their hypocrisy. If they could accept gay congregants the way they accept divorced congregants, the world would notice that the evangelical church is no longer self-righteous and judgemental and, frankly, angry. And then non-Christians might begin to realize that they can't use the Christian faith (or any other faith) to justify intolerance.
